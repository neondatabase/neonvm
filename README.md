# NeonVM: QEMU-based virtualization API and controlller for Kubernetes

## Description

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

#### 1. Create local cluster

```sh
kind create cluster
```

#### 2. Install cert-manager

```sh
make cert-manager
```

#### 3. Build Linux kernel for Guests

```sh
make kernel
```

#### 4. Build and deploy controller  to local cluster

```sh
make deploy
```

### Manage Virtual Machines

#### 1. Run virtual machine

```console
kubectl apply -f samples/vm-example.yaml
```

#### 2. Check VM running

```sh
kubectl get neonvm example

kubectl get neonvm example -owide

kubectl describe neonvm example
```

#### 3. Check logs

```sh
VM_POD=$(kubectl get neonvm example -ojsonpath='{.status.podName}')
kubectl logs $VM_POD
```

#### 4. Connect to console inside VM

```sh
kubectl exec -it $VM_POD -- screen /dev/pts/0

<press Enter to see output>
```
to exit from console presss `CTRL-a k` (see manual for `screen` tool)

#### 5. Plug/Unplug CPUs in VM

edit `.spec.guest.cpus.use` field by editor

```sh
kubectl edit neonvm example
```

or apply patch (set `cpus.use` to `2`)

```sh
kubectl patch neonvm example --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/guest/cpus/use", "value":2}]'
```

and then check status by `kubectl get neonvm example` and inspect `/sys/devices/system/cpu` folder inside VM

#### 6. Plug/Unplug Memory in VM

edit `.spec.guest.memorySlots.use` field by editor

```sh
kubectl edit neonvm example
```

or apply patch (as example set `memorySlots.use` to `4`)

```sh
kubectl patch neonvm example --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/guest/memorySlots/use", "value":4}]'
```

and then check status by `kubectl get neonvm example` and inspect memory inside VM by `free -h` command

#### 7. Do live migration

```sh
...soon
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster

### Test It Out

#### 1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

#### 2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

More information can be found via the [Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html)

## Roadmap

- [x] Implement Webhooks for mutation and validation
- [ ] Multus CNI support
- [x] Hot[un]plug CPUs and Memory (via resource patch)
- [ ] Live migration CRDs
- [ ] Simplify VM disk image creation from any docker image
- [ ] ARM64 support
